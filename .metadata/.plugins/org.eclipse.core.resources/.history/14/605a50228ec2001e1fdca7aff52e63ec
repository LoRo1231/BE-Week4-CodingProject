		a. Programmatically subtract the value of the first element in the array from the value in the last element of the array (i.e. do not use ages[7] in your code). Print the result to the console.  

		b. Create a new array of int called ages2 with 9 elements (ages2 will be longer than the ages array, and have more elements).  

		i. Make sure that there are 9 elements of type int in this new array.  

		ii. Repeat the subtraction from Step 1.a. (Programmatically subtract the value of the first element in the new array ages2 from the last element of ages2). 

		iii. Show that using the index values for the elements is dynamic (works for arrays of different lengths).

		c. Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the average age. Print the result to the console. */
